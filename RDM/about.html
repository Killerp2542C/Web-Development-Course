            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>In a cozy corner of their university library, RDM and Parth huddle over their laptops, engrossed in
                their collaborative C++ project. The air is filled with the soft tap of keys and the occasional murmur
                of excited discussion as they debate the best approach to implement a complex sorting algorithm. Parth,
                with her keen eye for elegant code structure, meticulously plans the class hierarchy while RDM, the
                debugging aficionado, hunts down elusive memory leaks with unwavering determination. Together, they
                navigate through challenging compiler errors and optimization puzzles, their enthusiasm growing with
                each line of code that comes together seamlessly. Their project, a ProgressTracker, promises to be not only a testament to their programming prowess but also a testament
                to their enduring friendship forged through countless hours of code and camaraderie.</p>
